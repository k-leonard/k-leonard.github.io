    <h1>Marvel: Data Assembled</h1>
    <p class="project-subtitle">Predicting & Explaining MCU Adaptation Success from Comic Storytelling DNA<br><em>Master’s Capstone — Kendall Leonard & Joshue Fuentes-Ventura</em></p>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is a superhero movie franchise that exploded onto the scene in 2008 with the premiere of <em>Iron Man</em> and has become one of the most successful film franchises in history. However, despite commercial success, many longtime fans have begun to question if the magic and creative spark that defined the franchise’s earlier phases has faded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The origin story of this project began with a simple but persistent question: why do some characters and storylines translate seamlessly to the screen while others, despite having rich and beloved source material, fail to resonate? Our goal was to understand the comic-specific storytelling elements—such as character development, power dynamics, team interactions, and narrative structure—that contribute to the success of adaptations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Data Sources</h2>
      <p>
        The data for this project originates from three primary sources: the official Marvel website (Marvel.com), Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDb. Marvel.com provided comprehensive information about characters, comic book issues, story arcs, powers, and team affiliations. IMDb was used to identify which comic characters had already appeared in the MCU. Rotten Tomatoes offered critical and audience response data, allowing us to define adaptation success as an audience score above 85.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our final dataset included 27,520 comics, 1,868 unique Marvel characters, and adaptation metadata for the complete set of MCU productions to date.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Data Organization</h2>
      <p>
        Our dataset integrates multiple streams of information—comic metadata, character details, MCU adaptation data, and audience/critic reception—into a unified relational structure. The schema captures character traits, comic metadata, adaptation linkages, and auxiliary attributes across over 20 interrelated tables.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Entity-relationship diagram visualizing our schema.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>
        Our analysis framed the problem as a binary classification task: given a comic issue’s metadata, could we predict whether it would be a strong candidate for a successful MCU adaptation? We trained three modeling strategies—Random Forest, constrained XGBoost, and Logistic Regression—each chosen for a specific reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        The constrained XGBoost model used shallow trees, strong regularization, and feature subsampling to generalize better. The logistic regression model offered transparent coefficients that directly show the direction and magnitude of each feature’s influence on the outcome. Finally, we averaged the two models’ predicted probabilities to create a composite success potential score.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        We prioritized sourcing information from official or semi-official platforms to ensure accuracy, attribution, and compliance with public data access guidelines. Marvel’s official descriptions often reflect the creative and cultural context in which they were written, so to avoid introducing systematic errors, we discarded automated classifications for gender or nationality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Predictive models like ours have real-world influence if used in industry settings. Our models are decision-support tools, intended to complement rather than replace human judgment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        Each dot in our visualization represents a single MCU or television release between 2008 and 2025. The earlier Marvel phases (2008–2018) maintained a fairly consistent audience reception, often in the 80–90% range. Since 2019, however, scores have become far more variable. Statistical testing confirmed significantly higher variability in scores, revealing that the MCU is no longer as consistent as it used to be.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>XGBoost:</strong> 89.9% accuracy, AUC 0.968, Kappa 0.4473, sensitivity 89.4%, specificity 92.9%.</li>
        <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> 81.2% accuracy, AUC 0.898, precision 96.5%, recall 71.0%, Kappa 0.425.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The most influential predictors were the number of issues in the series, the theme of civil conflict, the number of creators, and page count. Themes of scientific ethics, civil conflict, and social threats or uprisings also strongly correlated with success.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Top Recommendation</h2>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <p>
          Our top candidate was <em>Agents of Atlas (2006) #5</em>, with an XGBoost probability of 0.9988, a logistic regression probability of 1.0000, and a combined score of 0.9994. The issue features rivalries and power struggles, civil conflict, and national emergency-level threats, alongside infiltration, deception, mystery, and investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          These thematic drivers, combined with advanced technology and a diverse team structure, closely mirror the narrative DNA of past successful MCU adaptations.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Discussion & Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to identify promising MCU adaptation candidates by analyzing the structural and thematic DNA of the comics themselves. Many real-world factors that influence film success—such as casting, directing, visual effects, and marketing—were intentionally excluded. There is no official, comprehensive list linking individual comics to their screen adaptations, and subtle or context-dependent traits may have gone undetected.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      <p>
        Character-level modeling presents another significant opportunity. Future steps include experimenting with different weighting strategies for the ensemble, improving adaptation mapping, and expanding the analysis to non-MCU properties. By quantifying the narrative elements of source material, studios could make more informed choices about which stories to adapt.
