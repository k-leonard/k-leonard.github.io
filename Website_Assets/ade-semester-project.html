    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project delivers an end-to-end data pipeline for analyzing public transportation ridership and fare data.
      The system ingests, processes, and visualizes daily rider behavior and fare usage trends using Airflow, PostgreSQL, and Grafana. Our goal was to support data-driven decisions around fare policy, rider equity, and system performance.

    <h2>Skills & Tools Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Python (pandas, psycopg2)</li>
      <li>SQL (PostgreSQL)</li>
      <li>Apache Airflow (DAG scheduling, timezone handling)</li>
      <li>Grafana (dashboarding, time-series plots)</li>
      <li>Cloud storage (S3 buckets)</li>
      <li>Team collaboration with GitHub and Slack</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Ingestion:</strong> Created Airflow DAGs to scrape and export rider and fare data from APIs into S3 as JSON.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Organization:</strong> Designed and maintained dimension and fact tables in a PostgreSQL warehouse.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Loading:</strong> Used Airflow to transform and insert data from S3 into structured warehouse tables with timestamp handling.</li>
      <li><strong>Dashboarding:</strong> Built Grafana dashboards to track daily ridership, fare type usage, and performance over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Team Workflow:</strong> Iterated with teammates using GitHub issues, milestone reviews, and feedback-based revisions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated daily ingestion and transformation of ridership and fare data using custom Airflow DAGs</li>
      <li>Created robust fact and dimension tables that support flexible filtering and analysis</li>
      <li>Visualized key KPIs in Grafana, including peak ridership times and equity breakdowns by fare type</li>
      <li>Handled complex timezone issues and ensured timestamp accuracy across systems</li>
      <li>Produced clean, well-documented code and reproducible workflows</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This project taught me how to build reliable data infrastructure and collaborate on a complex technical workflow.
      The biggest challenge was debugging timezone misalignments across ingestion and warehouse stages â€” but solving it deepened my understanding of both Python and PostgreSQL datetime behavior.
      I'm proud of how our team handled feedback loops and iterated on dashboard design. In the future, I'd like to expand the system to support multi-year trends and machine learning-driven forecasting.
