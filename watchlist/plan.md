# checklist of things to do for this project

[] fix collection representaiton when altering filters
[] add more filters to collection, like release date?
[] fix up the browse tab(e.g the filters on the side, perhaps a bit like AO3, add more filters like date perhaps?
[] over all fix aesthetic, looks kinda mental hospitcal core right now
[] fix home page stats (want them going horizontal across the page)
[] perhaps alter the way you add a show, create an add show button and that is when the box pops up
[] change home page to show recently added shows, recently watched, and a random selection (like a recommendation list but without the complex system behind it)
[] maybe do implement a recommender system but like WAY later down the line
[] add in all of my current shows
[] perhaps make it so that on the show info page ratings are shown as stars, and when i go to edit them instead of entering a number i have the same star click method i do when i enter a show for the first time
