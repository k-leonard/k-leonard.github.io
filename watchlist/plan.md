# checklist of things to do for this project


- [ ] fix collection cards (get rid of open button and standardize size regardless of title length)
- [ ] fix the tropes filtering (I want the tropes filter to update if there are new options entered when entering new anime like the supernatural genre)
- [ ] perhaps make it so that on the show info page ratings are shown as stars, and when i go to edit them instead of entering a number i have the same star click method i do when i enter a show for the first time
- [ ] fix home page stats (want them going horizontal across the page)
- [ ] change home page to show recently added shows, recently watched, and a random selection (like a recommendation list but without the complex system behind it)
- [ ] over all fix aesthetic, looks kinda mental hospitcal core right now
    *  decide on aethetic. Dark anime aesthetic? Clean AO3 aesthetic? Or modern glass UI?
    *  add slide animation easing
    *  add slight shadow depth
    *  add a subtle border glow
    *  shift main content slightly right when drawer opens (like Notion)
- [ ] maybe do implement a recommender system on the home page but like WAY later down the line

- [ ] add in all of my current shows




~~- [x] fix collection representaiton when altering filters~~

~~- [x] add more filters to collection, like release date?~~

~~- [x] fix up the browse tab(e.g the filters on the side, perhaps a bit like AO3, add more filters like date perhaps?
    * [x] add back in the labels up top to the search
    * [x] the filters are kinda in the middle of the screen, move fully right
    * [x] the close button isn't working
    * [x] want the options vertical list style (ao3 style)
    * perhaps have count next to the selections (like ao3?) probably improvement for later
    * [x] make it so i can click on the title of a show from the browse screen and it will take me to the extended show listing in the collection~~

~~- [x] MOVE DELETE BUTTON AND ADD POPUP CONFIRMATION OF DELETEION (there are very few reasons as to why a show would need to be deleted)~~

~~- [x] add in way to check if name already exists when adding a new show~~
~~- [x] make it so that when i click the fetch info it can also grab release date, studios etc~~
~~- [x]  FIX adding shows, when i try to add a studio it doesn't pop up with any options same with other selects (works sometimes but then bugs out at a certain point not allowing for accurate user input)~~
    ~~* [x] perhaps alter the way you add a show, create an add show button and that is when the box pops up~~~
