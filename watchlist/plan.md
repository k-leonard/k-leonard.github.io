# checklist of things to do for this project

- [x] fix collection representaiton when altering filters

- [x] add more filters to collection, like release date?

- [ ] fix up the browse tab(e.g the filters on the side, perhaps a bit like AO3, add more filters like date perhaps?
    * add back in the labels up top to the search
    * the filters are kinda in the middle of the screen, move fully right
    * the close button isn't working
    * want the options vertical list style (ao3 style)
    * perhaps have count next to the selections (like ao3?) probably improvement for later
    * make it so i can click on the title of a show from the browse screen and it will take me to the extended show listing in the collection


- [ ] over all fix aesthetic, looks kinda mental hospitcal core right now
    *  decide on aethetic. Dark anime aesthetic? Clean AO3 aesthetic? Or modern glass UI?
    *  add slide animation easing
    *  add slight shadow depth
    *  add a subtle border glow
    *  shift main content slightly right when drawer opens (like Notion)

- [ ] fix home page stats (want them going horizontal across the page)

- [ ] perhaps alter the way you add a show, create an add show button and that is when the box pops up

- [ ] change home page to show recently added shows, recently watched, and a random selection (like a recommendation list but without the complex system behind it)

- [ ] maybe do implement a recommender system but like WAY later down the line

- [ ] add in all of my current shows

- [ ] perhaps make it so that on the show info page ratings are shown as stars, and when i go to edit them instead of entering a number i have the same star click method i do when i enter a show for the first time

- [ ] MOVE DELETE BUTTON AND ADD POPUP CONFIRMATION OF DELETEION (there are very few reasons as to why a show would need to be deleted)
- [ ] add in way to check if name already exists when adding a new show
