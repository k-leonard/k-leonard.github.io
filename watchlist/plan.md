# checklist of things to do for this project

- [x] enable recently added filter in collection
- [x] add in ability to edit what type of show a show is in the detail editor
- [x] add back in the delete show modal bc that got lost somewhere

- [ ] over all fix aesthetic, looks kinda mental hospitcal core right now
    *  decide on aethetic. Dark anime aesthetic? Clean AO3 aesthetic? Or modern glass UI?
    *  add slide animation easing
    *  add slight shadow depth
    *  add a subtle border glow
    *  shift main content slightly right when drawer opens (like Notion)
     
- [ ] maybe do implement a recommender system on the home page but like WAY later down the line
- [ ] add in all of my current shows BUT BEFORE DOING THAT WIPE EVERYTHING CLEAN SO WE START WITH ID OF 1 


~~- [x] fix collection representaiton when altering filters~~

~~- [x] add more filters to collection, like release date?~~

~~- [x] fix up the browse tab(e.g the filters on the side, perhaps a bit like AO3, add more filters like date perhaps?~~
  ~~* [x] add back in the labels up top to the search~~
    ~~* [x] the filters are kinda in the middle of the screen, move fully right~~
    ~~* [x] the close button isn't working~~
    ~~* [x] want the options vertical list style (ao3 style)~~
    * perhaps have count next to the selections (like ao3?) probably improvement for later

   ~~*[x] make it so i can click on the title of a show from the browse screen and it will take me to the extended show listing in the collection~~

~~- [x] MOVE DELETE BUTTON AND ADD POPUP CONFIRMATION OF DELETEION (there are very few reasons as to why a show would need to be deleted)~~

~~- [x] add in way to check if name already exists when adding a new show~~

~~- [x] make it so that when i click the fetch info it can also grab release date, studios etc~~

~~- [x]  FIX adding shows, when i try to add a studio it doesn't pop up with any options same with other selects (works sometimes but then bugs out at a certain point not allowing for accurate user input)~~

~~* [x] perhaps alter the way you add a show, create an add show button and that is when the box pops up~~

~~- [x] fix collection cards (get rid of open button and standardize size regardless of title length)~~

~~- [x] fix the tropes filtering I have to refresh a few times for the options to appear, is there any way to circumvent this.~~
~~- [x] perhaps make it so that on the show info page ratings are shown as stars, and when i go to edit them instead of entering a number i have the same star click method i do when i enter a show for the first time FIX RATINGS WHEN ENTERING A SHOW THE RATING ISN'T SAVING~~
~~- [x] make it so when i input a new show and it gets the anime info, it standardizes the title to the english alternative title (if it exists)~~
~~- [x] alter login method (make it username and password)~~
~~- [x] fix home page stats (want them going horizontal across the page)~~
- [x] alter the add show button so when you click the submit button it auto closes the miniwindow and a little popup in the lower right shows up green and says "Show Successfully added!" and the "Show already exists" is a redbanner that falls from the top of the add show mini window so you can't miss it
- [x] alter filter in browse to account for non anime
- [x] make it so shows that are "non-anime" do not have a fetch anime info button
- [x] change home page to show recently added shows, recently watched, and a random selection (like a recommendation list but without the complex system behind it)
      -partly through this, need to create "recently added" filter for the collection and fix the view all redirects on the front page

- [x] make it so shows that are "non-anime" do gave their own button/API to auto fill information
- [x] make it so you can add a date to the MAL look up
- [x] make home page cards clickable
- [x] fix add show studio/platform drop downs
- [x] fix detail editor to allow editing of platform
