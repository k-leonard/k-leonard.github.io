# checklist of things to do for this project

- [x] fix collection representaiton when altering filters

- [x] add more filters to collection, like release date?

* Main item
    * Sub-item 1
    * Sub-item 2
        * Sub-sub-item
* Another main item
    1. Mixed lists work
    2. With proper indentation

- [ ] fix up the browse tab(e.g the filters on the side, perhaps a bit like AO3, add more filters like date perhaps?
    * Sub-item 1
    * Sub-item 2
        - add back in the labels up top to the search
        - the filters are kinda in the middle of the screen, move fully right
        - the close button isn't working
        - want the options vertical list style (ao3 style)
        - perhaps have count next to the selections (like ao3?) probably improvement for later


- [ ] over all fix aesthetic, looks kinda mental hospitcal core right now
      - decide on aethetic. Dark anime aesthetic? Clean AO3 aesthetic? Or modern glass UI?
      -add slide animation easing
      - add slight shadow depth
      - add a subtle border glow
      - shift main content slightly right when drawer opens (like Notion)

- [ ] fix home page stats (want them going horizontal across the page)

- [ ] perhaps alter the way you add a show, create an add show button and that is when the box pops up

- [ ] change home page to show recently added shows, recently watched, and a random selection (like a recommendation list but without the complex system behind it)

- [ ] maybe do implement a recommender system but like WAY later down the line

- [ ] add in all of my current shows

- [ ] perhaps make it so that on the show info page ratings are shown as stars, and when i go to edit them instead of entering a number i have the same star click method i do when i enter a show for the first time

- [ ]
